## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow existing code style (we use `black` for formatting)
- Add type hints where possible
- Write docstrings for new functions and classes
- Include tests for new functionality

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/ -m unit
pytest tests/ -m integration

# Check test coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=science_live
```

### Documentation
- Update docstrings for any changed functions
- Add examples for new features
- Update the quickstart guide if needed

## üêõ Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, please include:

- **Science Live version**: `pip show science-live`
- **Python version**: `python --version`
- **Operating system**
- **Question you asked** (if relevant)
- **Expected vs actual behavior**
- **Error messages** (full traceback if possible)

### Example Bug Report
```
**Bug**: Pipeline crashes with ORCID queries

**Environment**: 
- Science Live: 0.0.1
- Python: 3.9.2
- macOS 12.1

**Question**: "What papers by 0000-0002-1784-2920?"

**Error**: 
```
KeyError: 'author'
  at science_live/pipeline/entity_extractor.py:45
```

**Expected**: Should return author's publications
```

## üí° Feature Requests

For new features, please:

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Describe the problem** your feature would solve
3. **Provide use cases** from your research experience
4. **Suggest implementation** if you have ideas

### Example Feature Request
```
**Feature**: Support for chemical formula queries

**Problem**: Researchers can't easily find papers mentioning specific chemical compounds

**Use Case**: "What papers discuss H2SO4?" should find chemistry papers

**Implementation Ideas**: Add chemical formula regex patterns to entity extraction
```

## üîß Development Workflow

### Setting Up Your Environment
```bash
# Create development branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Make changes and test
# ... edit files ...
pytest tests/

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "Add: Chemical formula entity extraction

- Recognize common chemical formulas (H2O, CO2, etc.)
- Add tests for chemistry domain queries
- Update documentation with chemistry examples"
```

### Pull Request Process
1. **Keep PRs focused**: One feature or fix per PR
2. **Write clear titles**: "Fix: ORCID entity linking error"
3. **Describe changes**: What you changed and why
4. **Link related issues**: "Fixes #123"
5. **Request reviews**: Tag relevant maintainers
